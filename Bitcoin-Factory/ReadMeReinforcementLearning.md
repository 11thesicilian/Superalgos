# Reinforcement Learning
## üí´ Introduction
[Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) is a term used to describe a special machine learning process. The typical framing of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) scenario: An agent takes actions in an environment, which is interpreted into a reward and a representation of the state, which are fed back into the agent.

In our usage case, the environment is a stock trading one and the possible actions are buy,sell or hold. The reward will be our gain or loss. Based on this reward the agent will learn how to trade better. The process of learning is done with a so called [Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal_Policy_Optimization).
